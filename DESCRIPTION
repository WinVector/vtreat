Description: A 'data.frame' processor/conditioner that prepares real-world data for predictive modeling in a statistically sound manner.
    'vtreat' prepares variables so that data has fewer exceptional cases, making
    it easier to safely use models in production. Common problems 'vtreat' defends
    against: 'Inf', 'NA', too many categorical levels, rare categorical levels, and new
    categorical levels (levels seen during application, but not during training).
    'vtreat::prepare' should be used as you would use 'model.matrix'.
