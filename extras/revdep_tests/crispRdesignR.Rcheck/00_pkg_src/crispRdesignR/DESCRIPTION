Description: Designs guide sequences for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and 
    provides information on sequence features pertinent to guide 
    efficiency. Sequence features include annotated off-target 
    predictions in a user-selected genome and a predicted efficiency 
    score based on the model described in Doench et al. (2016) 
    <doi:10.1038/nbt.3437>. Users are able to import additional genomes 
    and genome annotation files to use when searching and annotating 
    off-target hits. All guide sequences and off-target data can be 
    generated through the 'R' console with sgRNA_Design() or through 
    'crispRdesignR's' user interface with crispRdesignRUI(). CRISPR 
    (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) and the 
    associated protein Cas9 refer to a technique used in genome editing.
